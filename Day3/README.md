# Day 3: Conditional Logic and Control Flow

Today, you practiced how to control the flow of your Python program using conditional statements. You used `if`, `elif`, and `else` to create text-based decision games and explored logical reasoning through branching paths.

---

## âœ… Concepts Covered

### 1. Condition Operators
- Allow decisions based on conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### 2. Comparison Operators
- Used to compare values:
  - `==` (equal to)
  - `!=` (not equal to)
  - `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`

### 3. Logical Operators
- Combine multiple conditions:
  - `and`, `or`, `not`

### 4. Nested Conditionals
- Writing `if` statements inside other `if` blocks for multi-level decisions.

## ðŸ§¾ Files in This Folder

### ðŸ”¹ `treasure_island.py`
- A "choose your own adventure" game where the user must make correct choices to find the hidden treasure.
- Introduces multi-level decision logic and user interaction through input.

### ðŸ”¹ `haunted_house_escape.py`
- A spooky adventure game where the user navigates through a haunted house and makes decisions to escape safely.
- Includes multiple branching paths and a final decision with three key choices.

## ðŸŽ® Sample Output: Haunted House Escape

```
You wake up in a creepy haunted house...
There are two paths: one to the basement and one to the attic.

Do you go "basement" or "attic"? > attic

You climb up the creaky stairs into the dusty attic.
You see an old wardrobe and a window.

Do you "peek through the window" or "open the wardrobe"? > open the wardrobe

Inside the wardrobe you find three keys: one gold, one silver, and one rusty.

Which key do you choose? "gold", "silver", or "rusty"? > silver

The key unlocks a secret door! You escape into the sunlight. ðŸŽ‰ YOU WIN!
```

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Today you built your first interactive branching story game. You learned how to structure decision-based logic using nested conditionals and logical operators. These skills are essential for building intelligent, user-driven applications.
