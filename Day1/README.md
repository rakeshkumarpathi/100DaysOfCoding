# Day 1: Print Statements, Variables, and Input in Python

This day covers the basic building blocks of Python programming. You'll learn how to print text, take user input, store data in variables, and format strings using both concatenation and f-strings.

## âœ… Concepts Covered

### 1. `print()` Function
- Displays output on the screen.

### 2. `input()` Function
- Takes user input as a string from the console.

### 3. Variables
- Used to store data values (like strings or numbers).

### 4. String Concatenation
- Combines multiple strings using the `+` operator.

### 5. f-Strings (Formatted Strings)
- A cleaner and modern way to embed variables inside strings.

### ðŸ”¹ `band_name_generator.py`
- Takes user input for a city and pet name.
- Generates a fun "band name" using string concatenation and optionally f-strings.

### ðŸ”¹ `favorite_color.py`
- Takes user's name and favorite color.
- Displays a message using both concatenation and f-string.

### ðŸ”¹ `greeting_user.py`
- Greets the user by name using string formatting techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
Day 1 focuses on understanding how Python interacts with users through input/output and how to work with string data using variables and formatting techniques. These are essential foundations for building interactive programs.
