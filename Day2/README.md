# Day 2: Data Types, Arithmetic Operations, and More Practice

This day focuses on working with different data types and performing arithmetic operations in Python. You'll also continue practicing with `input`, `print`, and variables while applying your knowledge to real-world style problems.

---

## âœ… Concepts Covered

### 1. Data Types
- Python has several data types like `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.
- Type conversion is often needed when using `input()` as it returns a string.

### 2. Arithmetic Operations
- Python supports basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (exponent), and `%` (modulo).

### 3. Variables and Input
- Input is collected using `input()` and stored in variables for later use.

### 4. f-Strings
- A clean way to embed variables into strings for readable output.

### ðŸ”¹ `tip_calculator.py`
- Calculates how much each person should pay when a bill is split and a tip is added.
- Input: total bill, tip percentage, number of people.
- Output: the amount each person should pay, rounded to 2 decimal places.

### ðŸ”¹ `bmi_calculator.py`
- Calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight and height.
- Input: weight in kg, height in meters.
- Output: calculated BMI value.

### ðŸ”¹ `life_in_weeks.py`
- Calculates how many days, weeks, and months a person has left until age 90.
- Input: current age.
- Output: time left in days, weeks, and months.

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Day 2 builds your ability to perform mathematical operations and handle different data types. You practiced taking numerical input, performing calculations, and presenting the output in a user-friendly format using f-strings. These are critical steps toward writing interactive and meaningful Python programs.
